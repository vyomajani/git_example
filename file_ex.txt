This is my first Github project
Just testing things out

The order in which you want to do things:

1) If you are cloning an existing repository on GitHub to your computer (Change directories as needed)
git config --global user.email "vyomajani@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "vyomajani"
git clone https://github.com/16egong/peer_mentor_project.git
cp existingFile clonedRepository
git add '.\FileName'
git commit -m "Message"
git status (Check for issues)
git pull
git push

2) If you are creating a new repository


Git Cheat Sheet
git clone URL: clones an existing repository to create a new directory in the current one, that has the information existing online

git init: initialize an empty repo
git remote add origin git@github.com/user_name/repo
git push -u origin master
git status: displays tracked, modified, etc
git add file_name: add untracked or changed files to the potential commit
git commit -m "message": locally save files
git pull: always pull before you push!
potential merge conflict --> fix, status, add, commit, pull, tbd
git push: push to github

git checkout -b branch-name: creates separate branch and switches you to it
git checkout file-name: Delete changes made in the file
git reset --hard HEAD: erase everything you did since last commit
git reset --soft HEAD: did all changes, but didn't mean to hit save (want to change commit message) Ex. data should never be pushed to git
	Unadd huge files, but don't want to delete changes
git reset file-name: unadd the file (no longer being tracked)
